> But is Dreame really worth your time? How much do authors actually make? And how can you get started?

This article breaks it all down—real numbers, guidelines, community insights, and actionable steps to get paid for your stories.

**What is Dreame?**

Dreame is a mobile reading platform operated by Stary, a tech company based in Singapore with a global audience. The app focuses heavily on serialized storytelling—especially in the genres of billionaire romance, paranormal, mafia, teen fiction, and werewolf fantasy.

Readers access stories by unlocking chapters with coins, and writers earn money based on how many coins their stories generate. The more engaging your story, the more income you can potentially make.

**How Writers Earn Money on Dreame**

Unlike open self-publishing platforms, Dreame uses a contract-based system. This means only selected authors can monetize their work. Here’s how the income model breaks down:

**1. Pay-Per-Word Contract**

Dreame pays authors based on total words published, usually between $100 to $200 per 50,000 words, depending on your region and content quality. Payments increase as your book performs better.

**2. Revenue Share (Royalty)**

Writers also earn a percentage of reader spending. If readers use coins to unlock your chapters, you get a cut—typically 30–50%.

**3. Completion Bonuses**

Authors who finish stories under contract may qualify for additional bonuses, especially if they meet deadlines and maintain high engagement.

**4. Promotions and Challenges**

Dreame frequently runs author challenges with cash prizes, plus extra exposure in the app. Some writers report earning $1,000–$2,000/month by stacking contracts, bonuses, and consistent updates.

**Real Earnings: What Writers Are Saying**

From Reddit forums to Facebook groups, here’s what authors have shared about their Dreame experience:

- One author shared screenshots of monthly earnings ranging from $350 to $1,500, mostly from two full-length books under contract.
- Another user in a writing group said they earned $2,200 in one month, by writing 5,000+ words a day and maintaining two active stories.
- New authors typically earn $100–$400/month during their first 3 months if they stay consistent and follow Dreame’s guidelines.

Like any platform, results vary based on effort, genre, and reader appeal—but consistent writers are making real money.

**Dreame’s Contract Requirements and Guidelines**

To receive a contract, Dreame has some specific expectations. Here's what you'll need to qualify:

- Minimum 5–10 chapters uploaded before applying
- A clear story outline with popular tropes (e.g., bad boy alpha, CEO romance, reincarnation)
- Commitment to regular updates (3–7 times per week)
- A complete or ongoing story targeting at least 70,000–100,000 words
- Fluent English and minimal grammar errors

Contracts are offered after submission through Dreame’s Stary Writing platform. Once approved, you're assigned a content editor who monitors your progress and helps with formatting and quality.

**Payment Process and Delays**

Dreame processes payments via PayPal or Payoneer, with a typical wait time of 30–60 days after the story's approval or milestone. While some writers report delays or confusion in bonus calculations, others say that with proper documentation and communication, Dreame is reliable with payouts.

**To stay protected:**

- Keep screenshots of your contract
- Track word counts and chapter uploads
- Join author communities for insight and support

**How to Get Started (Even If You’re New to Writing)**

If you have a story idea but aren’t confident in your writing skills, you’re not alone—and you’re not stuck.

Many Dreame authors use AI tools like NovelAI or Sudowrite to help draft chapters, create outlines, and meet their daily word goals. Others turn to Facebook groups where experienced ghostwriters offer to write full books for a fee—or even as collaborators sharing profits.

You can also find pre-written story templates, genre-specific outlines, and writing partners who know what Dreame editors are looking for. With this kind of support, even total beginners can create a publishable, high-performing story.

**Who Is Succeeding on Dreame?**

The writers making the most on Dreame are those who:

- Write fast (1,000–3,000 words daily)
- Use popular genre tropes that readers crave
- Understand cliffhangers and pacing
- Collaborate or use tools to stay consistent
- Treat it like a job, not just a hobby

From college students to stay-at-home parents, nurses, teachers, and even software engineers, writers from all backgrounds are now earning monthly income through Dreame. All it takes is one well-structured story and the discipline to see it through.

**Is Dreame Worth It?**

If you enjoy writing romance or fantasy fiction and are willing to commit to consistency, Dreame can absolutely be a profitable writing platform. While it may not make you a millionaire overnight, it can bring in $300–$1,000+ per month with the right combination of quality, speed, and audience engagement.

For anyone looking to turn storytelling into real income, Dreame is not only accessible—it’s growing. With mobile fiction booming globally, there’s never been a better time to share your stories with the world and get paid to do it.

**What Negative Feedback Does Dreame Receive?**

While Dreame has opened doors for thousands of writers worldwide, it’s not without its fair share of criticism. Across platforms like Reddit, Facebook, and TrustPilot, several users have voiced concerns—ranging from contract clarity to payment issues. To make an informed decision, here’s a breakdown of the most common complaints from writers who’ve worked with Dreame.

**1. Vague or Restrictive Contract Terms**

One of the most recurring concerns among writers is the lack of clarity in Dreame’s contract terms. Many new authors—especially those unfamiliar with publishing legalese—report feeling confused by clauses related to exclusivity, royalty percentages, and completion requirements. Some say they didn’t realize they were signing an exclusive contract, which limits their ability to republish or reuse their work elsewhere. Others mention that royalties are not always transparently calculated, leaving them unsure about how much they’re actually earning per chapter or per word.

**2. Delayed or Missed Payments**

Another major issue flagged by authors involves delays in payments. Some writers report waiting several weeks or even months beyond the expected payout window. In certain cases, payment issues stem from miscommunication or incorrect documentation—like missing Payoneer information or not reaching the minimum threshold. However, others claim that even with proper documents submitted, payments were late or required repeated follow-ups with their assigned content editors. This can be especially discouraging for writers relying on timely income.

**3. Lack of Editorial Support**

While Dreame assigns content editors to contract writers, several authors report that the editorial support is inconsistent. Some editors are helpful and communicative, while others rarely respond to messages or take too long to offer feedback. In Facebook groups, writers have shared stories of editors vanishing mid-project or failing to help when technical issues arise on the Inkstone platform. This lack of support can leave authors feeling abandoned—especially when they’re expected to meet tight writing deadlines.

**4. Heavy Focus on Popular Tropes**

Dreame’s content guidelines are heavily centered around commercial tropes that are proven to attract reader attention—such as billionaire romance, werewolves, bad boys, mafia love interests, and contract marriages. While this formulaic approach helps the platform maintain reader engagement, many writers feel stifled by it. Some report that original or unconventional storylines are often overlooked, while genre diversity is not always encouraged. This makes it difficult for authors who want to explore literary fiction, horror, satire, or LGBTQ+ themes to succeed on the platform.

**5. High Pressure and Burnout**

Several authors also mention the intense writing schedule required to stay visible and competitive on Dreame. Many contracts require regular updates—sometimes daily chapter uploads—and large word count goals. While this can lead to increased earnings, it can also cause burnout, particularly for writers juggling other jobs or personal responsibilities. Some describe the experience as “writing in a factory” rather than creating art, due to the emphasis on speed and volume over thoughtful storytelling.

**6. Alleged Story Edits and Removals**

A few writers claim that their stories were edited or even removed without notice. In some cases, authors say they received vague feedback about violating content rules or failing to meet contract benchmarks, but weren’t given the chance to revise their work. Others say their stories were altered post-publication, leading to confusion about what was originally submitted. This lack of transparency can damage trust between authors and the platform, especially when livelihoods are at stake.

**Conclusion**

**Not a Perfect Platform, But Manageable with Awareness**

Like any publishing platform, Dreame has its strengths and flaws. While it does provide legitimate opportunities to earn money from writing, it’s important for aspiring authors to enter with realistic expectations, read the contract carefully, and join writer communities to stay informed. Most of the negative experiences stem from misunderstandings, lack of clarity, or poor communication—issues that can often be mitigated with due diligence. If you're prepared for the demands and understand the business model, Dreame can still be a viable and rewarding platform for serialized fiction writers.
